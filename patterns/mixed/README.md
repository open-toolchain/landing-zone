override                 | bool         | Override default values with custom JSON template. This uses the file `override.json` to allow users to create a fully customized environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |           | false


## Using override.json

To create a fully customized environment based on the starting template, users can use [override.json](./override.json) by setting the template `override` variable to `true`.

### Variable Definitions

By using the variable deifnitions found in our [landing zone module](../../landing-zone/) any number and custom configuration of VPC components, VSI workoads, and clusters can be created. Currently `override.json` is set to contain the default environment configuration.

### Getting Your Environment

This module outputs `config`, a JSON encoded definition of your environment based on the defaults for Landing Zone and any variables changed using `override.json`. By using this output, it's easy to configure multiple additional workloads, VPCs, or subnets in existing VPCs to the default environment.

### Overriding Only Some Variables

`override.json` does not need to contain all elements. As an example override.json could be:
```json
{
    "enable_transit_gateway": false
}
```

In this use case, each other value would be the default configuration, just with a transit gateway disabled. This allows users to change just the values needed.
